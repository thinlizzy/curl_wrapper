# curl_wrapper
A C++ wrapper for doing simple tasks on CURL. Very early alpha stage.

CURL is a very powerful library, but it is usually cumbersome for simple tasks.
The goal of this wrapper is to expose all the common use cases in a simple dumb way to use. No one likes to keep setting options manually all the time.
Expect lots of changes on this lib from now on.
